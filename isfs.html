    	<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
    	<p>The goal of our project was to create an installation that intervenes into a public space. We explored how strangers would engage and behave through our various design choices, and gave ourselves the challenge of giving instructions for our installation without it being vocalized or written down.

    <h3>FIRST ITERATION - ASHTRAYS</h3>
    <p><b>TARGET AUDIENCE:</b><br>Elderly community playing games
    <br><br>
	<b>INSTALLATION:</b><br>Ashtrays that we would place onto the tables in hopes of the elders using them. 
	<br><br>
	<b>INITIAL INTERACTION:</b><br>In the early morning, the people would go up to the ashtrays, look at them to see what they were, but then walk away. The park maintenance came around and started to throw them in the trash until we asked them if they could leave them where they were. Another woman who was sweeping threw two ashtrays away, but realized afterwards that they were intentionally placed there. She took them out of the trash and put them back on their velcro strips just as we got up to intervene. She told us that she realized what they were and that they “need them there because they smoke a lot.”</p>

	<p>As more elder people came to the park, they thought the ashtrays were trash and slapped them onto the ground. One man wacked one off with his cane, some women slapped another one away, and by the end of 3-4 hours of being there, four had been thrown away. On tables with the remaining trays, no one had placed a single cigarette into them. Most people did not understand its purpose right away and/or thought it was trash left behind.</p>

    <h3>SECOND ITERATION</h3>
    <p><b>TARGET AUDIENCE:</b><br> Children
    <br><br>
	<b>INSTALLATION:</b><br> Life-sized Angry Birds game and Life-sized Tic Tac Toe
	<br><br>
	<b>PROCESS:</b><br> Due to the result of our first iteration, we chose to move to a different area - the playground. The goal was to create a game that children will interact with, so we came up with two games: A life sized version of angry birds, and tic tac toe. We gathered cardboard boxes and spraypainted them red and yellow to match the design of the location. The kids would have to take a ball and throw them at the boxes to knock it down. </p>
<!-- 	<br><br>
	INITIAL INTERACTION: We arrived around 10:30am to set up, and then started our interaction around 11am. As soon as we brought the boxes, we were already gathering attention from the kids, who were curious as to what they were and what we were using them for. We started setting up the boxes to the design of the game, however before we could finish, the kids were already coming to interact with it in their own ways - some kids would build the boxes on top of each other, others would knock it down. We ultimately decided to let this interaction happen and see what they would do with just the boxes alone.</p> -->

	We attracted the attention from not only kids, but also parents. We also sparked the curiosity of a person from the Netherlands who was passing by the park. After an hour the boxes started to break open, and kids would continue to play by crawling inside the boxes and running around with each other. Kids would also take the boxes and throw them into the fountain area, then go back in to bring the boxes out of the area like a game. There was an interesting dynamic between kids who wanted to build, and kids who wanted to be destructive. As well as the kids who would scold the other kids for being destructive and running around the playground breaking them.</p>

		<b>PROCESS:</b><br> Due to the successful nature of our second iteration as compared to the first, we decided to interate off of the box idea by implementing the exquisite corpse factor, in which faces of characters, bodies, and legs would be drawn on the boxes and kids could turn the boxes to make their own character. </p>

	<p><b>INITIAL INTERACTION:</b><br> We came to the park later in the day this time - at 3pm. After we had set up, the boxes were placed in the middle of the playground with vocal instructions given. A group of boys, older than the age group last time, swarmed around the boxes and observed it. However they did not interact with it on first glance as it looked like an art piece not meant to be touched. After a while they came back and started knocking the boxes down, and would play a game in which they would flip one box on top of another box. This then progressed to them taking the boxes, throwing them around on the playground, and ultimately destroying them. There was one boy who would take a box and play a game of baseball in which he would swing the bat at the box.</p>

<p>Engaging interaction among strangers in NYC can be difficult. It was interesting to see the shift in this niche community when it came to our first interaction with elders as opposed to the interaction with children. Children are more likely to interact with new things, however, they are not very prone to following instruction. This project allows us to think about how a user might interact with a product and the different behavioral ways they may go about it as we all think a little bit differently.</p>
